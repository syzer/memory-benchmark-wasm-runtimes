# Benchmark for the memory footprint of different Wasm runtimes on MCUs

Still have to write a proper README. Should contain:

- What this repo is about
- Reference to FOSDEM and the talk (add link to talk later)
- Instructions about the setup of the dev board (and details on the board we are using)
- A note on how the repository is organized
- Instructions on how to run the benchmark with different runtimes


Notes:

- we have to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` first
